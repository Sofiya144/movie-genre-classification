ðŸŽ¥ Movie Genre Classification
This repository contains a Movie Genre Classification system designed to automatically predict the genre(s) of a movie based on its plot description, metadata, or other relevant features. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to perform multi-label classification.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes movie descriptions and metadata for analysis.
NLP Techniques: Uses TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other vectorization techniques to represent text data.
Multi-Label Classification: Handles movies with multiple genres using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers.
Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Technology Stack
Python: Core programming language for the project.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
NLTK/Spacy: Text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: For deep learning models, if applicable.
Jupyter Notebooks: For development, experimentation, and visualization.
Usage
Data Preparation: Preprocess the movie descriptions and prepare the data for training.
Model Training: Train the classification model using the provided scripts.
Prediction: Use the trained model to classify movie genres based on new descriptions.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data and visualize the results.
